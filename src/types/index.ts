/**
 * Main Types Export File
 *
 * This file re-exports all types from other files in the types folder.
 * This allows us to import types from a single location:
 *
 * Instead of: import { Project } from '@/types/components'
 * We can use:   import { Project } from '@/types'
 */

export * from './components';
